# NX versioning POC

In this example we will demonstrate how versioning works with the following 3 technologies:

- [NX Release](https://nx.dev/features/manage-releases): A tool for managing versioning and releases in NX workspaces.
- [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)
- [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
